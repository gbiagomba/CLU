#Enabling services first

#removing default files
#it looks like DBI is creating 3 users called deploy, serveruser and tempadmin. the -r flag is set to remove the sharepoint name... not the path where the shared data lives.
#to get a list of the sharepoints currently being shared, i'd use sharing -l and pipe those to variables and then remove the variable with no "". 
sudo sharing -r "deploy's Public Folder"
sudo sharing -r "server user's Public Folder"
sudo sharing -r "Temp Admin's Public Folder" 
read -p "Removing default shared files"
\n
#adding desired files
#-a adds the file, "\ " (note the trailing space) escapes the space and -S sets up an SMB sharepoint called 
sudo sharing -a /Store\ Server\ Images/ -S "Store Server Images" 
sudo sharing -a /Store\ Server\ Images/ -A "Store Server Images" 
read -p "Added Server Store Image sharepoint"
\n
#change  set user permissions
